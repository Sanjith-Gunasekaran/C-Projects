# C Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects I completed to practice problem-solving, algorithms, and foundational programming concepts.

## Projects

1. **Tideman (CS50)**  
   - Implemented the Tideman voting algorithm as part of CS50 coursework.  
   - Practiced arrays, structs, sorting, and algorithm design.

2. **Inheritance (CS50)**  
   - Simulated genetic inheritance using alleles for CS50 problem set.  
   - Developed understanding of data structures, loops, and conditional logic.

3. **Monty Problem**  
   - Custom project to explore probability concepts in C.  
   - Built a simulation of the Monty Hall problem to test and analyze outcomes.  
   - Practiced random number generation, loops, and statistical reasoning.

## Skills Practiced

- C programming fundamentals  
- Data structures (arrays, structs)  
- Control flow, loops, and conditionals  
- Problem-solving and algorithm design  
- Simulation and probability concepts
